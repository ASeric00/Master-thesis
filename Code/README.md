The model training was carried out entirely locally on a workstation equipped with an Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti (12 GB VRAM) graphics card, 64 GB of RAM, and a 13th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU. The entire environment was set up using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) tool.

The software environment was carefully configured to ensure mutual compatibility and the required performance. The following tools and their versions were used:
- CUDA Toolkit: 12.5
- cuDNN SDK: 9.3
- TensorFlow: 2.19
- Python: 3.9

All necessary tools and libraries were installed within the WSL environment to leverage native CUDA support and maximize GPU acceleration.
