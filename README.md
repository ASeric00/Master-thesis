This thesis investigates the use of conditional Deep Convolutional GANs (cDCGANs) to augment brain MRI dataset for dementia classification. It achieves this by first establishing a transfer-learning baseline with modern convolutional neural networks, then developing a class-conditional GAN to produce high-resolution MRI images. A comprehensive evaluation framework - combining generative quality and diversity metrics - confirms the realism of the generated images. The work systematically explores the impact of blending various proportions of synthesized data with actual images on classification performance. By demonstrating that carefully blended synthetic augmentation can offset data scarcity and render classification models more robust without compromising patient privacy, this work lays the groundwork for continued advances in medical image synthesis, including higher-resolution generation and more powerful GAN architectures.
